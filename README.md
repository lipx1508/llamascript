# Old llamascript compiler
"A multi-paradigm scripting language for embedded systems, written in C++"

## NOTE:
The compiler was archived because it is going to get a reimplementation. I don't think this one is modular enough or easier for embedded systems since it relies *way too much* on heap memory and other wacky C++ features. The project is not dead, it will just be rewritten to ensure better coding standards and readability.
